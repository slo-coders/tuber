    Babel uses these "presets" to know how to transpile your code:
      'react': teaches Babel to recognize JSX
      'env': teaches Babel to transpile Javascript. You can reduce the size of your bundle by limiting the number of features/plug-ins you transpile. Learn more at: https://github.com/babel/babel-preset-env
